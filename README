Smart Hire: Smart Resume Analyzer

Smart Hire is a JavaFX-based application created to make resume screening simpler, 
fairer, and more meaningful. Instead of relying on basic keyword matching, 
the system uses a pre-trained AI model [1] (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
to understand resumes in context and evaluate how well a candidate aligns with a job description.

Smart Hire explores how AI-assisted tools can support recruiters by providing clear insights, 
while still leaving the final decision to humans.

- Reads resumes in PDF and DOCX formats
- Analyzes resumes using a pre-trained NLP model
- Compares resumes with job descriptions semantically
- Calculates a candidate relevance score
- Highlights matched and missing skills
- Presents results in a clean, interactive JavaFX interface

At the core of Smart Hire is a pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP)
model used to extract meaning from text rather than just matching keywords.
This allows the system to:

- Recognize related skills and concepts
- Understand context within resumes
- Provide more realistic and useful evaluations

This is what makes Smart Hire an intelligent system, not a traditional rule-based application.

Design & Architecture

The project follows a Model–View–Controller (MVC) structure:

- Model – Represents resume data and analysis results
- View – JavaFX UI built with FXML and Scene Builder
- Controller – Handles user actions and system logic
- This separation keeps the code organized, readable, and easy to extend.

Object-Oriented Principles Applied

Smart Hire was intentionally designed to demonstrate core OOP concepts:

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Exception Handling
These principles are applied throughout the system to ensure maintainability and clarity.

Possible Future Improvements

- Persisting candidate data using a database
- Supporting more document formats
- Adding recruiter-specific dashboards
- Improving AI scoring explanations
- Exporting analysis results
